<PROJECT DESCRIPTION>


## Features

* TODO


## Install for development
The dependencies are `postgres` and `virtualenv`.
```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database in your postgres install called `nolij`. If there is a user, update as such in
`config.py` - for example, the url would become `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/nolij`.
